# CSCI1300 Final Project
 This is the first project I ever completed, and is a small program that runs in the terminal and acts as a login portal to a university, allowing the user to log in with a username and password, as well as manage classes. This program allows the user to login as a student or registrar with a username and password. The user is then able to access all student records as the registrar, and enroll in classes based on prerequisites as the student. In this project, I used C++ along with data structures to provide myself with a foundation for object oriented programming.
